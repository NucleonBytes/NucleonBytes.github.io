          Unlike some web-development and design agencies, we take pride in our work. We ensure that our client's needs are met promptly, with efficiency and individuality. Unless otherwise stated by our clients, every website we create is written completely from scratch, using our very own set of libraries and tools.

        <h1 style="color:#ff4a4a">Open Source</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="bigp">
          Because of the countless plugins and scripts available in the open-source community, we have been able to create and improve our skills as well as our clients' and partners' products. We love to contribute too! The libraries we use to make our clients' products so super-duper awesome are all hosted on Github, available for anyone to use and improve.

        <h1 style="color:#ebe934">Responsive</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="bigp">
          With more and more of the population accessing websites on the go, the need for responsive website designs have become a necessity. Responsive Web Design is a fluid website development framework that enables your contents to adapt to any screen size, in turn allowing quicker and smoother user experience on any devices, including smartphones and tablets. This is why we have decided to always build with mobile in mind.

        <h1 style="color:#d694ff">Time is Money</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="bigp">
          We believe that time is money. Wasted time means money lost on a potentially good idea. That's why we promise to deliver a prototype within 2 weeks of development. That is also why we simply dont wireframe; wireframing is time we could be using to create an interactive prototype for our valuable clients.

      <br>
      <h1><i class="material-icons">extension</i></h1>
      <br>
      <p class="bigp">We have invested a lot of time into making our own development tools so that developing for our client was fast, effective and above all, productive. Our prefered sets of IDEs are Sublime, Atom, and Tizen8. Tizen8 is our web-powered development tool created using open source plugins, to help us develop state of the arts websites and web-applications.</p>
